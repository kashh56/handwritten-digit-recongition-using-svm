Summary of How the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier Streamlit App Works

This MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier app uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model trained on the MNIST 
dataset to predict 
handwritten digits (0-9) from user-uploaded images. 

Below is a step-by-step explanation of how the app works:

App Workflow:

1.User Uploads an Image:

- The user uploads a handwritten digit image (in formats like .jpg, .png, or .jpeg) through a file uploader 
widget in the Streamlit app.
- The image is displayed on the web page for preview.

2.Preprocessing the Uploaded Image:

- The uploaded image is first converted to grayscale (if itâ€™s not already). This standardizes the image to match the format of the MNIST
  dataset.
- The image is resized to the required input size of 28x28 pixels, which is the expected input size for the MNIST model.
- The image is then inverted if necessary (to make the digit black on a white background, as MNIST digits are white on black).
- The image is normalized, ensuring that pixel values are in the range [0, 1], which is the standard format expected by the model.

3.Prediction:

- After preprocessing, the image is flattened into a 1D array (28x28 = 784 features).
- The preprocessed image is passed to the trained SVM model, which was previously trained on the MNIST dataset.
- The model predicts the digit represented by the image based on its learned features.

4.Display Prediction:

- The predicted digit is displayed on the web page, showing the user the model's best guess for the uploaded handwritten digit.

Key Features:

--SVM Model: The app uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on the MNIST dataset. The model learns to classify digits
 based on patterns in pixel values.
--Image Preprocessing: Essential preprocessing steps like resizing, grayscale conversion, binarization, and normalization are applied 
to ensure that the input image is compatible with the model.
--Streamlit Interface: The app uses Streamlit to provide an interactive, user-friendly interface, allowing users to upload images
 and get predictions easily.

Technology Stack:

== Streamlit: For creating the web-based user interface.
== Pillow (PIL): For image processing tasks such as resizing, converting to grayscale, and thresholding.
== Scikit-learn (SVM): For the machine learning model used to classify handwritten digits.
== Joblib: To load the pre-trained SVM model.

User Experience:

== Upload a handwritten digit image.
== View the processed image in the app.
== Get the predicted digit (0-9) from the SVM model.

This app leverages the power of machine learning (SVM) and image preprocessing to make accurate predictions of handwritten digits,
 providing an easy-to-use tool for digit recognition.
